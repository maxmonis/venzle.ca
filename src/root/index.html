        <strong>How to Play</strong>
        <p>
          The puzzle is made up of overlapping yellow, blue, and red circles.
          Your job is to place all seven items in the puzzle so that the four
          items in each circle have something in common which no other items do.
        </p>
        <p>Here is an example:</p>
        <div class="circle-container">
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-c"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-c"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-c"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-c"></span>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-a">Watermelon</div>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-ab">Grape</div>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-abc">Orange</div>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-ac">Apple</div>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-b">Purple</div>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-bc">Pine</div>
          <div class="dropzone dropzone-c">Cedar</div>
          <div class="circle-title circle-title-a">Fruit</div>
          <div class="circle-title circle-title-b">Color</div>
          <div class="circle-title circle-title-c">Tree</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Orange is in the center because it alone is a fruit, color, and tree.
          Grape is a fruit and a color but not a tree, apple is a fruit and a
          tree but not a color, and pine is a tree and a color but not a fruit.
          The remaining three items each only fit in one category.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example above, yellow is Fruit, blue is Color, and red is Tree,
          but the specific colors are arbitrary. All that matters is that one
          circle contains all four fruits, another contains all four colors, and
          the final one contains all four trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can make up to five guesses, and have two hints available in case
          you get stuck (plus a bonus hint once you've used the other two). Try
          to solve each puzzle using the fewest guesses and hints possible, a
          perfect game uses no hints and only one guess. Good luck and have fun!
