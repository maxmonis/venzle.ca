        <p>
          The four items in each circle each have something in common which the
          other three items do not. This means that the item in the center will
          be the only one which fits into all three categories, the items in the
          intersections of two circles will each fit into two of the three, and
          the items in only one circle will fit into one.
        </p>
        <p>Here is an example:</p>
        <div class="circle-container">
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>

          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-c"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-c"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-a"></span>
          <span class="circle circle-b"></span>

        </div>
        <p>
          Canada is in the center because it alone is a constitutional monarchy
          which touches the arctic circle and has English as an official
          language. The United States is not a monarchy, Sweden does not have
          English as an official language, and Australia does not touch the
          arctic circle. The other three countries each only fit in one
          category.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example above, yellow is English, blue is arctic, and red is
          monarchy, but the specific colors are arbitrary. All that matters is
          that one circle contains all four countries which are monarchies,
          another contains all four which touch the arctic circle, and the final
          one contains all four where English is officially spoken.

          You can make up to three guesses, and have two hints available in case
          you get stuck (plus a bonus hint once you've used the other two). Try
          to solve each puzzle using the fewest guesses and hints possible. Good
          luck and have fun!
