        <p>
          Drag and drop all seven items into the puzzle. Each circle will
          represent a category, and each item in that circle must fit into that
          category. This means that the item in the center will be the only one
          which fits into all three categories, the items in the intersections
          of two circles will each fit into two of the three, and the items in
          only one circle will fit into one.
        </p>
        <p>Here is an example:</p>
        <img src="/example.png" />
        <p>
          Canada is in the center because it alone is a constitutional monarchy
          which touches the arctic circle and has English as an official
          language. The United States is not a monarchy, Sweden does not have
          English as an official language, and Australia does not touch the
          arctic circle. The other three countries each only fit in one
          category.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn't matter which color you use to represent each category. In
          the example above, yellow is English, blue is monarchy, and red is the
          arctic, but the specific colors are arbitrary. All that matters is
          that one circle contains the four countries which are monarchies,
          another contains all four which touch the arctic circle, and the final
          one contains all four where English is officially spoken.
